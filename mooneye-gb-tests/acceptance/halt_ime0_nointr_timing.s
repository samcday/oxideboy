; This tests whether HALT adds any kind of delay in the IME=0 case
;
; HALT is expected to immediately continue execution, with exactly
; same timing as if a long series of NOP instructions were used to wait
; for the interrupt

; Verified results:
;   pass: DMG, MGB, SGB, SGB2, CGB, AGB, AGS
;   fail: -
