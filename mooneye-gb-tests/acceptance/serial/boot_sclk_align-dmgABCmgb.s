; Tests when a serial transfer completes if one is started after boot.
; Expectations:
;   - the transfer doesn't start immediately
;   - serial clock is divided from the main clock with a big counter, so
;     clock edges align based on the *reset time*, not the time when SC is
;     written to

; Verified results:
;   pass: DMG ABC, MGB
;   fail: DMG 0, SGB, SGB2, CGB, AGB, AGS
