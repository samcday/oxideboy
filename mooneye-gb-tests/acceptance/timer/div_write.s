; This test verifies that the timer is affected by resetting the DIV register
; by writing to it. The timer uses the same internal counter as the DIV
; register, so resetting DIV also resets the timer.
; The basic idea of this test is very simple:
;   1. start the timer
;   2. keep resetting DIV in a loop by writing to it
;   3. run N iterations of the loop
;   4. if an interrupt happened, test failed

; Common reasons for failing this test:
;   "FAIL: INTR"
;     Your emulator does not use the internal counter for the timer, so DIV
;     resets did not prevent the timer increase and interrupt from happening

; Verified results:
;   pass: DMG, MGB, SGB, SGB2, CGB, AGB, AGS
;   fail: -
