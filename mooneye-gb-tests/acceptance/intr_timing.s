; Serving an interrupt is supposed to take 5 M-cycles.
; We know from div_timing that this code should not see a div increment:
;   reset_div
;     nops 61
;   ld a, (hl)
; On the other hand, this code should see the increment:
;   reset_div
;     nops 62
;   ld a, (hl)
; We set up a similar scenario by triggering an interrupt using IE/IF flags.
; In total we have
;   reset_div
;     x nops               x cycles
;     trigger_intr 2 + 3 = 5 cycles
;     interrupt handling:  5 cycles
;     jp hl                1 cycle
;   ld a, (bc)
; So, x=50 is equivalent to the nops 61 case,
; and x=51 is equivalent to the nops 62 case

; Verified results:
;   pass: DMG, MGB, SGB, SGB2, CGB, AGB, AGS
;   fail: -
