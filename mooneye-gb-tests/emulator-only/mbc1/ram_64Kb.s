; Tests banking behaviour of a MBC1 cart with a 64 Kbit RAM
; Expected behaviour:
;   * RAM is disabled initially
;   * When RAM is disabled, writes have no effect
;   * Since we have only one 8 KB bank, we always access it regardless of what
;      we do with $4000 and $6000

; Results have been verified with MBC1 research
