# oxideboy

Game Boy emulator, implemented in Rust.

Nothing to really see here yet, unless you're really into terrible codez.

# Current TODO list:

 * Implement all CPU instructions
 * Implement timer interrupt
 * Pass all gb-test-roms tests in: cpu_instrs + instr_timing + interrupt_time + mem_timing + mem_timing-2 + oam_bug
 * Refactor lr35902 to be a little less horrible
 * Implement video
 * Implement sound
 * Implement MBC1 cart
