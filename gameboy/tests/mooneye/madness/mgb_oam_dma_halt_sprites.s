; This tests the weird behaviour when the CPU is halted when OAM DMA is
; active *and* the existing OAM data and new OAM data match certain patterns

; The basic idea is very simple:
; 1. Prepare OAM DMA (run in hiram)
; 2. Halt after the OAM DMA has started
; 3. Observe results
; No interrupts are enabled, so the CPU never wakes up, but the GPU is still
; drawing. However, since OAM DMA is in the middle of OAM access
; (but not proceeding with it!), the GPU will see weird values and does
; not render normally.

; The actual result depends on several things:
; - "magic values" that decide whether the GPU renders any sprites at all
; - the new OAM byte that was being written when the CPU clock halted
; - the existing byte that was supposed to be replaced when the CPU clock halted
; - the existing byte *after* the previous one

; Verified behaviour:
;   MGB: As described here and visualized by *_expected.png
;   DMG: A different sprite (probably different logic with the values)
;   CGB: Checkerboard without sprites (probably different logic with the values)
;   AGB/AGS: A different sprite (probably different logic with the values)

; In this test $30 is the byte that was supposed to be replaced, and $40 is the next byte.
; Only these bytes matter, and the Y and X values ($FF) are never used.

; In this case the sprite will be rendered as if this was the data:
; Y: ($30 | $1A) & $FC = $38  -> Y = 56
; X: $40 | $1A = $5A          -> X = 90

; F: $40 | $1A = $5A          -> Above BG, horizontal flip, OBP1 palette

; Why & $FC? I have no idea, but it seems that the low two bits are always 0

; The four values must be within these ranges:

;   $00 - $A7  =    0 - 167  <- this is the visible range for X values (yes, 0 is included)

;   $00 - $A7  =    0 - 167  <- this is the visible range for X values (yes, 0 is included)
; If any value is out of range, the data will have no effect.
