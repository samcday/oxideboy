; This test verifies that the timer count changes are actually triggered
; by bit 7 going low when writing to the DIV register in 16384 Hz mode.
;
; 128 cycles after resetting the internal div counter, bit 7 of the 
; internal div counter will have been set. Writing to the DIV register
; at this time will cause bit 7 to change from high to low which in
; turn triggers a timer increment.

; Verified results:
