; This test rapidly starts and stops the timer.
; There are two behaviours that affect the test:
;   1. starting or stopping the timer does *not* reset its internal counter,
;      so repeated starting and stopping does not prevent timer increments
;   2. the timer circuit design causes some unexpected timer increases

; Common reasons for failing this test:
;   "FAIL: NO INTR"
;     Your emulator starts counting the timer when it is started or stopped.
;     This is incorrect, because in real hardware starting/stopping the timer
;     simply flips a single bit, and the timer state is otherwise preserved.
;   BC < $FFF8
;     Your emulator does not emulate the unexpected timer increases, so the
;     interrupt happens too late.

; Verified results:
;   pass: DMG, MGB, SGB, SGB2, CGB, AGB, AGS
;   fail: -
