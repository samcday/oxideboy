; This tests what happens in the first few cycles of OAM DMA.
; Also, when OAM DMA is restarted while a previous one is running, the previous one
; is not immediately stopped.

; Expected timing (fresh DMA):
; M = 0: write to $FF46 happens
; M = 1: nothing (OAM still accessible)
; M = 2: new DMA starts, OAM reads will return $FF

; Expected timing (restarted DMA):
; M = 0: write to $FF46 happens. Previous DMA is running (OAM *not* accessible)
; M = 1: previous DMA is running (OAM *not* accessible)
; M = 2: new DMA starts, OAM reads will return $FF

; Verified results:
;   pass: DMG, MGB, SGB, SGB2, CGB, AGB, AGS
