; DIV increments are supposed to happen every 64 cycles,
; and the "internal counter" is supposed to reset when DIV is reset
;
; ld a, (hl) is expected to have the following timing:
; M = 0: instruction decoding
; M = 1: memory access from (HL)

; Verified results:
;   pass: DMG, MGB, SGB, SGB2, CGB, AGB, AGS
;   fail: -
