; This tests DI instruction timing by setting up a vblank interrupt
; interrupt with a write to IE.
;
; This test is for DMG/MGB, so DI is expected to disable interrupts
; immediately
; On CGB/GBA DI has a delay and this test fails in round 2!!

; Verified results:
;   pass: DMG, MGB, SGB, SGB2
;   fail: CGB, AGB, AGS
