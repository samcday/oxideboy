  push af

  ; This time we have only 56 NOPs, so the next read should happen immediately
  ; *before* the increment because we're altering the relative phase and

  ; Since we're back to 57 NOPs, the next read should happen once again
  ; immediately *before* the increment. Phase is not changed here, but the change
